# Weather-App

# Description

We were asked to create a weather app that displayed the weather for the current day, as well as 5 days into the future. Including the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. A search bar with a history. When a city that is in the history is clicked, you are presented with that city's weather. When you re-open the dashboard, you are presented with the last searched city forecast.

## Issues

The main issues were learning and using the weather API. Trying to figure out what all the response data was.

## Collaborators
