# Weather App

We were asked to create a weather app that displayed the weather for the current day, as well as 5 days into the future. Including the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. A search bar with a history. When a city that is in the history is clicked, you are presented with that city's weather. When you re-open the dashboard, you are presented with the last searched city forecast.
